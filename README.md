# Portfolio

Portfolio putting HTML and CSS skills to the test, featuring projects, some personal information and thoughts.

## The problem

The project included a set design that I used when creating my portfolio. A lot of effort was put into making the site accessible, tesing it and adjusting code to make it accessible for people using screen readers or relying on high contrast to be able to see the content.

## Learning objectives
